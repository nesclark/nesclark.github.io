			<h1>Hi, I'm Nick.</h1>
			<p> I'm currently training as a full stack developer with the iO Academy. I have always had a keen 
interest in problem solving and understanding systems. By the end of this course I aim to be proficient in the development of both front-end and back-end aspects of websites and applications. I aim to have a strong understanding of languages such as HTML, CSS and Javascript, in addition to other server-side languages such as Python and PHP.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>Using a pre-built API containing a list of English Counties we made a javascript game where the player has 30 seconds to guess as many English Counties as they can. User input is validated and then cross referenced with the data stored as JSON. Correct guesses are displayed in real time on the page. Once the timer is up the player’s score is recorded and can be submitted to an API for display alongside other high scores.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>Using the React framework and a pre-built RESTful API we created a food delivery app where users could select from a range of restaurants and food items. We made use of react hooks such as useState to keep track of the order basket and useEffect to fetch the data from the API to populate the app.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>Using OO PHP and a pre-built front end we constructed a back end API for a project management app. A combination of entities and hydrators populate information about projects and users from the database and then display this in the app. User input is validated and overdue deadlines for projects are calculated using Static Service Classes.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>For this project we worked on a legacy codebase from previous i0 Academy graduates. The project is an iO Academy website where admin users can perform a variety of functions to manage students and courses. We used a combination of FE Javascript and BE PHP to expand functionality for admin users to keep track of available spaces on courses and specify how many in person and remote places are available for new courses.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>For this collection app I used a combination of HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL to dynamically display information from the database and allow users to upload new information via an 'add new plant' function. This new item is then displayed on the main page along with the rest of the collection.</p>

				<div class="project-description">
					<p>In this BE Javascript exercise I used the Express node framework and MongoDB to send, retrieve, update and delete data from a database. I refactored parts of the code into modules to avoid repetition and then unit tested the functionality of these modules.</p>
